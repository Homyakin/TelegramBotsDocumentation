# Lesson 5. Deploy your bot

I hope that, when you are reading this, you have created your own bot with the help from my book.
So now, it's time to run it not on your home computer ~~with Intel Pentium II~~, but on professional server hardware. 
I will show how to deploy your bot on [DigitalOcean hosting](https://m.do.co/c/1a3a7fad419f).

## Creating droplet

Firstly, you need to create an account on DigitalOcean.
Open [this link](https://m.do.co/c/1a3a7fad419f) to get 10$ as gift from me,
enter your email and password and click "Create an account"

![Register](do_register.png)

Then, follow register instructions. Once you are in your control panel, create a new droplet.

Select OS. 
I recommend using Ubuntu 16.04.01 x64. 
Then choose your preferred plan. 
For Java bot, you can select 512â€“1GB RAM \(its enough for start\).
Select datacenter's region \(I recommend choosing your nearest city\), scroll down and click "Create."
Check your email inbox for an email like this:

## Connecting via SSH

You will need next software for that:

* [PuTTY SSH Client](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
* [FileZilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)

When you install it, open PuTTY and write server IP and port \(default 22\).

And click "Open." You will see something like:

Click "Yes." Then login as "root" user and with the password that you have received via email. 

Now we need to install Java on your server. You can follow this [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-on-ubuntu-22-04)

Type `java -version` to check installation. You will see something like that:

## Creating and uploading JAR

Now, open `IntelliJ Idea` and go to File&gt;Project Structure&gt;Artifacts&gt; + \(Add artifact\)&gt;JAR&gt;From modules with dependencies&gt;Select main class \(`Main.java`\)&gt;OK&gt;Apply. Then Build&gt;Build Artifacts&gt;Build. Then in the `out/artifacts/` folder you will see your JAR.

### Uploading to the server

Open FileZilla and enter IP address, username, password and port \(default 22\) and click "Connect."
Create a new folder on your server \(right window\),
open it, and upload your JAR by dragging it from your left window \(local computer\) to right window \(server\). 
Open PuTTY and type:

```bash
screen
```

Press `ENTER` and then go to your folder:

```bash
cd FOLDER_NAME
```

And run your JAR:

```bash
java -jar FILE.jar
```

Well done! You are now hosting your bot at DigitalOcean. To exit terminal, press `CTRL + A + D` and then type `exit`. To return, connect via SSH, type `screen -r` and you will be returned to your screen session. To stop the bot: `CTRL + C`.

Well, that's all for now. See you soon!
